## [WB025 Sequencing Library Preparation] NGS_library_preparation_for_long-read_sequencing
| Briefly describe this workflow (edit the template below to fit your purpose)
| This workflow prepares DNA or cDNA/RNA libraries for next-generation sequencing (NGS). Typical steps include fragmentation (or amplicon input), end-repair/A-tailing, adapter ligation, and barcoding/indexing (native barcode multiplexing), followed by cleanup, size selection, quantification, and normalization/pooling. It supports 96/384-well automation and outputs sequencing-ready, quality-controlled libraries for downstream NGS runs.
