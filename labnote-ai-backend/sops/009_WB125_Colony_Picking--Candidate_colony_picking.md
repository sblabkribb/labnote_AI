## [WB125 Colony Picking] Candidate_colony_picking
| Briefly describe this workflow (edit the template below to fit your purpose)
| This workflow isolates single bacterial colonies from solid media after transformation or screening and transfers them to liquid media or fresh plates using automated colony pickers or manual pipetting. It supports 96/384-well array formats, barcode/sample tracking, and rule- or image-based selection (e.g., size, color, fluorescence). Outputs are clonal cultures suitable for downstream verification (e.g., genotyping, sequencing) and protein expression analysis.
