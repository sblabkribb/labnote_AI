## \[WB045 DNA Extraction\] Plate-based_plasmid_prep

| Briefly describe this workflow (edit the template below to fit your purpose)
| This workflow focuses on releasing DNA from biological samples (e.g., cultured cells, tissues) through lysis and initial separation from major cellular components like proteins and lipids.

### \[UHW250 Nucleic Acid Purification\] DNA extraction

-   **Description**: The process of purifying DNA or RNA from biological samples using an automated device. It ensures high purity and yield for downstream applications.

#### Meta

-   Experimenter: Wonjae
-   Start_date: '2025-08-17 13:41'
-   End_date: ''

#### Input

-   Cultured cell without supernatant (LMP001)

#### Reagents

-   Cosmogenetech LaboPass Plasmid Mini prep Kit
    -   S1 buffer 
    -   S2 buffer
    -   S3 buffer
    -   PW buffer
    -   EB buffer

#### Consumables

-   Cosmogenetech LaboPass Plasmid Mini prep Kit
    -   spin column
    -   collection tube
-   reservoir
-   pipette tip
-   1.5mL tube
-   waste bottle
-   paper towel

#### Equipment

-   pipette
-   multi-channel pipette
-   microcentrifuge

#### Method

-   Remove the supernatant using a multi-channel pipette.

-   Add an appropriate volume of S1 buffer to the reservoir, dispense 83 ŒºL into each well with a multi-channel pipette, and pipette up and down for resuspension

    -   Resuspension step (sometimes performed by vortexing)

    -   Components: RNase A (RNA degradation after lysis; added to S1 instead of S2 because RNase A requires cold storage, while SDS in S2 tends to precipitate upon refrigeration), EDTA (chelates divalent cations to destabilize the cell wall), Tris-HCl (maintains neutral pH), glucose (maintains osmotic balance)

-   Add S2 buffer into the reservoir, dispense 83 ŒºL into each well, pipette gently, and incubate for 5 min (pH indicator: white ‚Üí blue)

    -   Lysis step (do not vortex)

    -   Components: NaOH (denatures chromosomal and plasmid DNA; plasmid DNA remains less denatured due to its supercoiled structure), SDS (disrupts cell membranes and denatures proteins)

-   Add S3 buffer into the reservoir, dispense 117 ŒºL into each well, pipette gently (pH indicator: blue ‚Üí white)

    -   Neutralization step (do not vortex)

    -   Components: potassium acetate (precipitates proteins, allows renaturation of plasmid DNA)

-   Transfer each sample to a 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube

-   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 10 min

    -   High-density bacterial chromosomal DNA and proteins form a pellet, while plasmid DNA remains in the supernatant

-   Insert spin columns into collection tubes and label according to sample number

-   Transfer the supernatant to the spin column and incubate for 1 min

    -   Under high-salt conditions, plasmid DNA binds to the membrane

-   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 min

-   Discard the flow-through and add 750 ŒºL of PW buffer to each column, followed by centrifugation at 13,000 rpm for 1 min

    -   Wash step

    -   Ethanol (lower polarity than water; DNA remains bound while salts are dissolved)

-   Discard the flow-through and centrifuge again at 13,000 rpm for 1 min

    -   Removes residual PW buffer

-   Transfer the spin column to a clean 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube

-   Add 40 ŒºL of EB buffer directly to the center of the membrane and incubate for 1 min

    -   Elution step (sometimes performed with distilled water)

-   Centrifuge at 13,000 rpm for 1 min

#### Output

-   Plasmid DNA for long-read sequencing (Sample plasmid #)
